# iBoardThings

When working on several IoT project with differents data, sensor or/and clients, we need an interface to have an overview of everything.
Actually, there are several CMS like ThingsBoard, Arduino IoT Cloud or Particle who offer a complete paid service for everyone but I wanted to create a template pretty simple and free for myself where I could do the same things in an environment where I have the full control.
I currently working on it but it will be available for everyone soon.
Feel free to propose new amelioration/idea :)

## Installation

To start the project, there will be some installation to do (I promise I will automate evrything soon).

1. Clone the project with `git clone git@github.com:Jouskaio/iBoardThings.git`

2. Go the API part and install the virtual environnement using the requirement.txt

3. I'm working on a temporary local database so I didn't need to hide theses informations but I advise you to connect to another database in the API > setting.py 

4. Go the web part and do `npm install` then `npm start`

The project is currently not working because it's in development and I hide several important information
